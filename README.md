## Question 1. Define Sample Probability and Real Probability

**Answer â†’**

### ðŸ”¹ Real Probability
Real (or Theoretical) Probability refers to the probability calculated using logic or mathematical assumptions â€” without actually performing any experiments. It tells us the *true likelihood* of an event happening under ideal conditions.

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

**Example:**  
When tossing a fair coin,  
\[
P(\text{Head}) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]  

This probability remains the same, no matter how many times we toss the coin â€” 10, 100, or even 1000 times â€” because itâ€™s based on the assumption that the coin is fair.

### ðŸ”¹ Sample Probability
Sample (or Empirical) Probability, on the other hand, is based on *real observations* or *experiments*. It is calculated by observing how often an event actually occurs during repeated trials.

\[
\hat{P}_N(A) = \frac{n(A)}{N}
\]

where:  
- **N** = total number of trials  
- **n(A)** = number of times event *A* occurred  

**Example:**  
If we toss a coin 100 times and get 76 heads,  
\[
\hat{P}_{100}(\text{Head}) = \frac{76}{100} = 0.76
\]  

This value (0.76) is our *sample probability* â€” an estimate of the *real probability (0.5)*.  
As we increase the number of trials, the sample probability starts getting closer to the real one.
Over time and with more data, sample probability gradually approaches the real probability.
