## Question 1. Define Sample Probability and Real Probability

**Answer:**  

**Real Probability**  
- Formula: P(A) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes  
- Example: Tossing a fair coin  
  P(H) = 1/2 = 0.5  
- Notes:  
  - This probability **does not change**, no matter how many times you toss the coin (100 times, 200 times, etc.)  
  - Based on the **model of fairness**  

**Sample Probability**  
- Formula: Pn(A) = n(A) / N  
  - N = Total number of trials  
  - n(A) = Number of times event A actually occurred  
- Example: Tossing a coin 100 times and getting 76 heads  
  P100(Head) = 76 / 100 = 0.76  
- Notes:  
  - This probability is based on **actual observation** from the sample
