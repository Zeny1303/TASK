# TASK

## Question 1. Define Sample Probability and Real Probability

**Answer:**  

**Real Probability** — The theoretical probability calculated using the number of favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes.  

- **Formula:**  
  P(A) = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes  
- **Example:**  
  When tossing a fair coin:  
  P(H) = 1/2 = 0.5  
- **Notes:**  
  - This probability **does not change**, no matter how many times you toss the coin (100, 200, etc.).  
  - It is based on the **model of fairness**.  

---

**Sample Probability** — The probability calculated from **actual observations** or experimental data.  

- **Formula:**  
  Pₙ(A) = n(A) / N  
  Where:  
  - N = Total number of trials  
  - n(A) = Number of times event A actually occurred  
- **Example:**  
  Tossing a coin 100 times and getting 76 heads:  
  P₁₀₀(H) = 76 / 100 = 0.76  
- **Notes:**  
  - This probability is based on **actual observation** from the sample.  

Hence, **sample probability** is our experimental estimate, while **real probability** represents the ideal theoretical model.

## Question 2. Difference Between Expectation and Average

Expectation and Average (Mean) both describe the central tendency of data, but they differ in how they account for the **probability of each value**.

---

### 🔹 Average (Mean)
The **average** is a special case of the expected value where **all outcomes are equally likely**.

**Formula:**
```
X̄ = μ = (ΣX) / n
```

Where:  
- X̄ → Sample mean  
- μ → Population mean  
- ΣX → Sum of all values  
- n → Number of values  

**Example (Equal Probabilities):**  
If X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
```
X̄ = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 3.5
```

---

### 🔹 Expected Value
The **expected value** considers the **probability** of each outcome.

**Formula:**
```
E[X] = Σ (X * P(X))
```

Where:  
- X → Each possible outcome  
- P(X) → Probability of that outcome  

**Example 1 — Equal Probabilities:**  
If X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
and  
P(1)=1/6, P(2)=1/6, P(3)=1/6, P(4)=1/6, P(5)=1/6, P(6)=1/6  
Then,  
```
E[X] = 1*(1/6) + 2*(1/6) + 3*(1/6) + 4*(1/6) + 5*(1/6) + 6*(1/6)
E[X] = 3.5
```
Here,  
```
E[X] = X̄
```
because all probabilities are equal.

**Example 2 — Unequal Probabilities:**  
If X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
and  
P(1)=3/20, P(2)=3/20, P(3)=3/20, P(4)=3/20, P(5)=1/5, P(6)=1/5  
Then,  
```
E[X] = 1*(3/20) + 2*(3/20) + 3*(3/20) + 4*(3/20) + 5*(1/5) + 6*(1/5)
E[X] = 3.7
```

Here,  
```
E[X] = 3.7
X̄ = 3.5
```

Thus, **average** is a special case of **expected value** when all probabilities are equal.

## Question 3. Law of the Unconscious Statistician (LOTUS)

### Definition
**LOTUS** stands for **Law of the Unconscious Statistician**.  
It allows us to compute the **expected value of a function of a random variable** without first finding the distribution of that function.

---

### 🔹 Formula

#### For Discrete Random Variables:
```
E[g(X)] = Σ g(x) * P(X = x)
```

#### For Continuous Random Variables:
```
E[g(X)] = ∫ g(x) * f_X(x) dx
```

Where:  
- g(X) → Function of the random variable X  
- P(X = x) → Probability mass function (PMF)  
- f_X(x) → Probability density function (PDF)

---

### 🔹 Intuitive Explanation
To find **E[g(X)]**, you **don’t need to find the distribution of g(X)**.  
You can compute it directly using the **distribution of X**.

---

###  Example (Discrete Case)
If X = {1, 2, 3} with probabilities {0.2, 0.5, 0.3}, and we want E[X²]:  
```
E[X²] = Σ x² * P(X = x)
       = 1²(0.2) + 2²(0.5) + 3²(0.3)
       = 0.2 + 2 + 2.7 = 4.9
```

---

###  Example (Continuous Case)
If X has PDF f(x) = 2x for 0 < x < 1, and we want E[X²]:  
```
E[X²] = ∫₀¹ x² * 2x dx
       = 2 ∫₀¹ x³ dx
       = 2 * (1/4) = 0.5
```

## Question 5. How Generative Model uses Joint Probability Distribution for generating new data

**Generative Models** are a class of machine learning models that don’t just classify or predict — they *learn the underlying structure* of data.  
Their goal is to understand **how data is generated** in the real world, so they can create entirely new, realistic data samples that follow the same patterns.  

For example, **GPT models** such as *ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok* are trained on large-scale text datasets.  
They learn deep statistical patterns — relationships between words, context, and meaning — allowing them to generate new and coherent text that seems human-written.  

---

### **Joint Probability Distribution**

For a set of random variables \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \), the **joint probability distribution**  

$$
P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)
$$  

represents the probability of all these variables occurring together.  
In simpler words, it tells us how likely it is to see a particular *combination* of variables in real-world data.  

A **generative model** tries to *learn this joint probability distribution* of the training data, denoted as \( P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) \), such that it becomes as close as possible to the **true data distribution**:

$$
P_{\text{real}}(X)
$$  

This real distribution \( P_{\text{real}}(X) \) captures how the actual data is naturally structured — for instance, how pixels form an image or how words form a meaningful sentence.  

The model builds its own learned distribution:

$$
P_{\theta}(X)
$$  

where \( \theta \) represents the model’s parameters (like weights in a neural network).  
This learned distribution reflects what the model believes is likely, based on the data it has seen during training.  

The training objective is to adjust \( \theta \) so that:  

$$
P_{\theta}(X) \approx P_{\text{real}}(X)
$$  

When both distributions align closely, the model effectively “understands” how the real data behaves — allowing it to generate new, yet realistic, data points.

---

### **How Models Generate New Data**

Once the model has learned \( P_{\theta}(X) \), it can *sample* from this distribution to create new data.  
Since learning the joint probability directly is complex, most models use **Sequential Generation**, where data is produced step by step:

1. **Start with the first variable:**  
   Generate \( X_1 \) based on its individual probability \( P(X_1) \).
2. **Conditional generation:**  
   Next, generate \( X_2 \) based on \( P(X_2 | X_1) \).
3. **Continue sequentially:**  
   Then generate \( X_3 \) based on \( P(X_3 | X_1, X_2) \), and so on.

Mathematically, this process can be represented as:  

$$
P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = P(X_1) \times P(X_2 | X_1) \times P(X_3 | X_1, X_2) \times \cdots \times P(X_n | X_1, X_2, ..., X_{n-1})
$$  

This breakdown allows models like **GPT** to predict the *next token or word* given the previous sequence, and models like **Diffusion** or **VAE** to generate structured image or sound data from learned latent representations.  

---

### **Key Insight**

By mastering the joint probability distribution, the generative model essentially learns the *rules of reality* from data.  
It doesn’t memorize examples — it learns the probability of how features, pixels, or words *co-occur*.  
That’s what enables it to generate entirely new yet realistic samples that reflect the same underlying patterns as the training data.  

---

### **In Summary**

A **Generative Model** uses the **Joint Probability Distribution** to learn the hidden structure of real-world data.  
By aligning the model’s probability \( P_{\theta}(X) \) with the true probability \( P_{\text{real}}(X) \), it develops the ability to **generate new, high-quality data** — just as GPT writes human-like text or DALL·E creates lifelike images.  

> ✨ *Generative models don’t just replicate data — they learn its logic and use it to imagine something new.*

## Question 9 . Consider a quiz game where a person is given two questions and must decide which question to answer first. Question 1 will be answered correctly with probability 0.8, and the person will then receive as prize $100, while question 2 will be answered correctly with probability 0.5, and the person will then receive as prize $200. If the first question attempted is answered incorrectly, the quiz terminates (the person is not allowed to attempt the second question). If the first question is answered correctly, the person is allowed to attempt the second question.Which question should be answered first to maximize the expected value of the total prize money received?
## ANSWER : The player should answer the 0.8-probability $100 question before the 0.5-probability $200 question.

Given in Question :-
| Question | Probability of Correct | Prize |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Q1       | 0.8                  | $100  |
| Q2       | 0.5                  | $200  |

It is clearly mentioned in question :
1. If the **first question is wrong**, the game ends.  
2. If the **first question is correct**, the player can attempt the second question.  

Here , we need to maximize expected total prize.
So, There are two cases 
#### Case 1:-Answer Q1 first, then Q2
1.Probability Q1 is correct = 0.8 → Win $100
2.Probability Q2 is correct if Q1 was correct = 0.5 → Win additional $200

Expected Value :
```
EV=(Probability Q1 correct)×[Prize for Q1+(Probability Q2 correct×Prize for Q2)]
𝐸𝑉=0.8×[100+(0.5×200)]

𝐸𝑉=0.8×[100+100]=0.8×200
EV = $160
```

#### Case 2: Answer Q2 first, then Q1

Expected Value :
```
EV=(Probability Q2 correct)×[Prize for Q2+(Probability Q1 correct×Prize for Q1)]
𝐸𝑉=0.5×[200+(0.8×100)]

𝐸𝑉=0.8×[200+18]=0.5×280
EV = $140
```
So even though Q2 offers a higher individual prize ($200), the higher probability of Q1 ($100 with 0.8 probability) gives a higher expected value when answered first.

1. If we start with Q2(0.5 probability),there's a 50 % chance that game ends immediately , so we never get the easier amount of $100 from Q1.
2. If we start with Q1 (0.8 probability),there's a high chance secure the smaller prize first, and then we have still a chance to win a bigger prize.
